# PDF-Search-with-GPT
An experiemntal project to utilize LangChain and extract information from PDFs, utilizing OpenAI Text Embeddings.

The project utilizes LangChain and OpenAI Text Embeddings to extract information from PDF documents. The PDFs are split into smaller chunks using a text splitter and then embedded with OpenAI Text Embeddings. The embeddings are used to search for relevant information using a full-text search engine. The extracted information can then be used for various purposes, such as information retrieval or natural language processing tasks. This experimental project demonstrates the potential of combining different tools and technologies to extract information from unstructured data sources like PDFs. The below diagram helps explain the modules involved as well as how this project works.
